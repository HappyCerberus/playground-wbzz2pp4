# $`O(1)`$ data structure

An exercise in understanding performance characteristics of different data structures.

Implement a class with the following methods, all with $`O(1)`$ time complexity:

```C++
class Constant {
	public:
		// Insert new key with value 1, or if key is already present, increase it by 1.
		void inc(const string& key);
		// Decrease the value of a key by 1. If the value is already 1, remove it from the data structure.
		void dec(const string& key);
		// Return one of the keys with maximum value. Return "" if datastructure is empty.
		string getMaxKey() const;
		// Return one of the keys with minimum value. Return "" if datastructure is empty.
		string getMinKey() const;
};
```

In this article, we will go through the deconstruction of this problem and build up the solution step by step.

## Analyzing the problem

Let's establish some baseline of what we can definitely do (ignoring $`O(1)`$ time complexity requirement for now).

Fetching the maximum and minimum out of an unsorted sequence requires $`O(n)`$ complexity.
